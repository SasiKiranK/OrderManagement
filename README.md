Kafka event â†’ product.created in product-catalog â†’ search-service consumes and indexes it
help me on this

how to know how es indexing the pridyct details and  what are index's and what can be custamized and optimzation techniqyes 
when to use mutiple indexes

ðŸ§± Updated Tech Stack
âœ… Spring Boot â€“ Order, User, Cart services

âœ… FastAPI â€“ Catalog, Notification, Admin services

âœ… PostgreSQL â€“ Orders, users, cart

âœ… MongoDB â€“ Product catalog

âœ… Elasticsearch â€“ Product search

âœ… Kafka â€“ Real-time event propagation

âœ… Docker Compose â€“ Service orchestration (instead of Kubernetes)

âœ… Nginx / Traefik (optional) â€“ API Gateway & routing (optional, simple config)















ðŸ§  What FAANG SDE-2s Are Expected to Know
Hereâ€™s what you should definitely learn or strengthen, organized by category:

1. Programming Language Mastery
âœ… Java (assumed via Spring Boot) â€“ master threading, collections, memory management

ðŸ‘Œ Optional: Add Python, Go, or C++ as a second language

2. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
Absolutely mandatory for FAANG interviews!

Topics to master:

Arrays, Strings, LinkedLists, Trees, Graphs

Dynamic Programming

Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Recursion

Heaps, Tries, Union-Find

Platform practice:

LeetCode (must)

Codeforces / CodeChef for competitive angle

Grokking the Coding Interview (paid course)

3. System Design (High Priority)
Focus on Low-Level and High-Level Design

Concepts:

Load Balancing, Sharding, Caching Strategies

Event-driven architecture

Rate Limiting, API Gateway, Circuit Breaker

CAP theorem, Consistency Models, Idempotency

Resources:

Grokking the System Design Interview

System Design Primer (GitHub)

4. Distributed Systems (Must-Have for SDE-2+)
Concepts to know:

Consensus algorithms (Paxos, Raft)

Eventual consistency, Leader election

Microservices vs Monolith, Saga Pattern

Kafka Internals (you're already starting this, go deep!)

5. Cloud & DevOps
Learn AWS, GCP, or Azure (at least one)

EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, SNS/SQS, IAM

Understand:

CI/CD pipelines

Logging, Monitoring (ELK, Prometheus, Grafana)

IaC: Terraform or CloudFormation

6. Testing & Observability
Testing: JUnit, Mockito, Integration Tests, Contract Testing (e.g., Pact)

Observability:

Metrics, Logs, Tracing

Tools: Zipkin, Jaeger, Prometheus

7. Security (Often Overlooked)
OAuth2, JWT, CSRF, CORS

Encrypting data at rest / in transit

Role-based access control

8. Soft Skills
Design Doc writing

Clear communication in code reviews & standups

Mentoring juniors or peers (for SDE-2 expectations)

ðŸ§­ Path Ahead (Prioritized Order)
DSA (LeetCode) â€“ ðŸš€ start immediately

System Design â€“ ðŸ“˜ 2x/week study & mock sessions

Kafka Deep Dive â€“ finish soon

AWS or GCP fundamentals

Distributed Systems + LLD

Source control mastery (GitHub flow, PR etiquette)

If you'd like, I can build you a custom 8-week plan to get interview-ready. Just say the word!
